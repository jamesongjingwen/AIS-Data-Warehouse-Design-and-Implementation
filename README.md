# AIS-Data-Warehouse-Design-and-Implementation

### Overview

Project StarAIS is a comprehensive business analytics project focused on the design and implementation of a data warehouse to manage and analyze Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages. This project aims to provide a robust platform for querying and understanding maritime traffic data, leveraging the power of data warehousing and database management.

### Features

    - Data Warehouse Design: Developed a data warehouse specifically tailored for AIS message data, utilizing a star schema for efficient querying and scalability.
    - PostgreSQL Implementation: Implemented the data warehouse in PostgreSQL, showcasing skills in database design and SQL programming.
    - Data Ingestion and Transformation: Automated the process of data ingestion from AIS message sources, including data cleaning and transformation for warehouse integration.
    - Interactive Query Interface: Created an intuitive python interface for users to query and interact with the AIS data, offering insights into maritime traffic patterns and behaviors.
    - Data Analysis and Visualization: Enabled comprehensive data analysis capabilities, including trend identification and visualization of maritime data.

### Technologies Used

    Database Management: PostgreSQL
    Data Modeling: Star Schema Design
    Programming: SQL, Python (for data processing and interface development)

### Project Goals

The primary objective of Project StarAIS is to provide a scalable and efficient solution for maritime data analysis. This includes:

    Offering a centralized repository for AIS message data.
    Enabling complex queries and analytics on maritime traffic.
    Providing insights into maritime safety, traffic patterns, and vessel behaviors.
